# Insights-for-Sales-Database

Use the story module in tableau and use the Dykes' Storytelling Arc to show where a company can be improved. 
The reader is drawn in from the background of the data, then some facts about the data are introduced, gradually leading to the topic and indicating the main problems or areas of improvement found.

Based on the data given, it was found that one of the sales channels (wholesalers) of a company had negative profits during the year and that the total profits were changing gradually over time. 
It was found that the transport routes were not maximising the benefits leading to the status quo, so appropriate adjustments were made to the transport methods and a significant increase in returns was found, thus maximising profits.
